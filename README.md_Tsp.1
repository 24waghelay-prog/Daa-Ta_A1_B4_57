# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver

This project provides a Python implementation of the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using a backtracking approach. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.


## Overview

The TSP is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. This implementation uses a brute-force approach to explore all possible paths and determine the shortest route based on a given distance matrix.
